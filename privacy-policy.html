    <div style="background: #eaf6ff; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; border-radius: 4px; margin: 15px 0;">
        <h3>What SMS Messages We Send</h3>
        <p>The G2G Church App may send a one-time SMS text message to new users when a church administrator or authorized family member creates an account on their behalf. This message contains app download links (for Google Play Store and Apple App Store) and login instructions to help the new user access their account.</p>

        <h3>How Consent is Obtained</h3>
        <p>When a church administrator or authorized family member creates an account for a new user through the G2G Church App, they are presented with a <strong>"Notify User About Their New Account"</strong> checkbox. This checkbox is <strong>unchecked by default</strong>. The administrator or family member must actively check this box to authorize sending a one-time SMS notification to the new user. The administrator or family member is responsible for obtaining the new user's verbal or written consent before enabling this notification.</p>

        <h3>Message Frequency</h3>
        <p>Users will receive a <strong>maximum of one (1) SMS message</strong> per account creation event. This is a one-time notification, not a recurring messaging program.</p>

        <h3>Message and Data Rates</h3>
        <p>Message and data rates may apply. Please contact your mobile carrier for details about your text messaging plan.</p>

        <h3>Opt-Out</h3>
        <p>You may opt out of receiving SMS messages at any time by <strong>replying STOP</strong> to any message received from G2G Church App. After opting out, you will receive a confirmation message and will no longer receive SMS messages from us.</p>

        <h3>Help</h3>
        <p>For help with SMS messaging, <strong>reply HELP</strong> to any message received from G2G Church App, or contact us at <a href="mailto:info@g2g.church">info@g2g.church</a>.</p>

        <p>Mobile carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.</p>

        <h3>Phone Number Privacy</h3>
        <p>Your phone number will not be shared with or sold to third parties for marketing purposes. Your phone number is collected solely for account creation and one-time notification purposes.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
